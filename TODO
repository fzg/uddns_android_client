* Settings: 
	set ip, port, user, password, name
* Background activity:
	on network change, perform update


[optionality.level=1]
 We'd need a main activity with a short description,
 a link to the github of the server, 
 [optionality.level=2]
  a tick box to enable/disable
 [/optionality]
[optionality]


CURRENTLY:
It seems that the bootupreceiver runs (since settings are shown) <- double check it tho ;)
BUT
It seems the backgroundactivity should morph into a service
